# Weather Forecast

A small web app that displays a one day weather forecast for a specific city. Uses https://openweathermap.org/ to fetch the weather data and React/Redux to render the interface.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Run `npm install` from the root directory, to install the necessary node modules locally.

### Usage

`npm start` should spin up a server at `localhost:8080` to view the app in your browser.

If making changes, open another console tab and use `npm run dev` which will watch for changes and rebuild.
