# Weather Forecast

A small web app that displays a one day weather forecast for a specific city. Uses https://openweathermap.org/ to fetch the weather data and React/Redux render the interface.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Run `npm install` from the root directory, to install the necessary node modules locally.

`npm start` should then spin up a server at `localhost:8080` to view the app in your browser.

If making changes open a different console tab and use `npm run dev` which will watch for changes and rebuild.

### Usage

Run `npm run dev` and `npm start` to start `nodemon` and the dev server.
